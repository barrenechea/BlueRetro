# BlueRetro

<p align="center"><img src="/static/PNGs/BRE_Logo_Color_Outline.png" width="600"/></p>
<br>
<p align="justify">BlueRetro is a multiplayer Bluetooth controllers adapter for various retro game consoles & computers. Lost or broken controllers? Reproduction too expensive? Need those rare and obscure accessories? Just use the Bluetooth devices you already got! The project is open source hardware & software under the CERN-OHL-P-2.0 & Apache-2.0 licenses respectively. It's built for the popular ESP32 chip. Wii, Switch, PS3, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S & generic HID Bluetooth (BR/EDR & LE) devices are supported. Parallel 1P (Computers, NeoGeo, Supergun, JAMMA, Handheld, etc), Parallel 2P (Atari 2600/7800, Master System, Computers, etc), NES, PCE / TG16, Mega Drive / Genesis, SNES, CD-i, 3DO, Jaguar, Saturn, PSX, PC-FX, JVS (Arcade), Virtual Boy, N64, Dreamcast, PS2, GameCube & Wii extension are supported with simultaneous 4+ players using a single adapter.</p>

## Fork notes

This tree tracks upstream `e1a9831` ("Farewell", archived) plus an ESP-IDF v6.0.2
port, an HW2 SNES iBlueControl board overlay, and a consolidated set of Switch 2
controller fixes drawn from the RyanCopley, Last-Colossi, bjerreman and
LaserBear Industries forks. See the git log for per-change detail and
attribution.

### Switch 2 controller support

Supported over Bluetooth LE: **Pro Controller 2** (`0x2069`), **NSO GameCube**
(`0x2073`), and **Joy-Con 2** left (`0x2067`) and right (`0x2066`). A controller
type this build does not recognise falls back to the Pro Controller 2 layout
rather than delivering no input.

There is no Switch 2 NSO SNES, N64, NES or Mega Drive controller. Those pads are
Switch 1 devices on Bluetooth BR/EDR, supported by a different code path
entirely and unaffected by any of this.

Known limitations:

* **Pairing a Switch 2 controller to BlueRetro unpairs it from a Switch 2
  console.** The controller stores one host pairing, so the console's entry is
  overwritten. Re-sync on the console (cable or the sync button) to use it there
  again. This is a property of the controller, not of the adapter.
* **Joy-Con 2 halves work one per player, held sideways**, like Switch 1
  Joy-Cons. Merging a left and right half into a single controller is not
  implemented.
* **Two simultaneous BLE controllers is the practical radio limit.** The ESP32
  cannot advertise, scan and service links at once, so advertising stops once
  two are connected and resumes when a slot frees. Pairing several controllers
  at the same moment can still collide; pair them one at a time.
* **Motion, mouse and headset-audio features are not implemented.**

### GameCube builds: combo buttons differ from upstream

Super Smash Bros. Melee resets a match on **L + R + A + Start**, which is exactly
upstream's `SYS_POWER_OFF` combo, so every match reset also tells the adapter to cut
power. GameCube builds therefore base the combos on `PAD_MQ` rather than `PAD_MM`
(Start), and swap reset and power off onto A and B:

| Combo | Action |
| --- | --- |
| L + R + Capture + A | System reset |
| L + R + Capture + B | System power off |
| L + R + Capture + X | Bluetooth pairing toggle |
| L + R + Capture + Y + D-pad Up | Factory reset |
| L + R + Capture + Y + D-pad Down | Deep sleep |

`PAD_MQ` is the Capture button on a Switch 2 GameCube pad, the Capture button on a
Switch Pro pad, and the touchpad click on a DS4/DualSense. **Controllers with no
`PAD_MQ` — notably the Wii U Pro and PS3 pads — cannot satisfy the combo base and
lose every combo on a GameCube build.** Remap `COMBO BASE 3` to another button in the
web config to restore them. Non-GameCube builds keep the upstream defaults.
